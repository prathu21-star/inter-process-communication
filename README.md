## IPC Project

This repository contains a set of Java programs for inter-process communication (IPC). The project includes a client-server communication system where the client sends a demand number to the server, and the server executes the corresponding Java program based on the demand received.

##mContents
The repository includes the following Java files:

Client.java: Implements the client-side code for sending demands to the server.
Server.java: Implements the server-side code for receiving demands and executing the corresponding Java program.
ContentsOfFolder.java: Displays all directories in a specified directory.
DisplayFileSize.java: Retrieves the file size of a specified file.
EmptySpace.java: Displays the amount of empty space in a specified directory.



## Usage


Start the server by running the Server class.
Run the Client class to interact with the server.
Enter a demand number (1 to 3) to execute the corresponding Java program on the server.
The server will process the demand and return the result to the client.
Please make sure to update the file paths in the Java programs (ContentsOfFolder.java, DisplayFileSize.java, and EmptySpace.java) to match your system configuration.

## Requirements


Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
Network connection between the client and server machines
